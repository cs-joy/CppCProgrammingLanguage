## This is why others learn efficiently

### Holistic learning step
1. Obtain different processing for different acquired information:

Five different kinds of information: random information, opinion information, process information, concrete information, and abstract information. Random information: a certain piece of history. == "Using the idea of ​​interlocking. For example, when we forget where to put the key, we will definitely think about the place where the key was last taken out, what clothes we were wearing at the time, and following this line of thinking, we will finally find the key. Set up a scene for this information, which is easy to remember.

Opinion information: There are controversial opinions, and there is a process of argumentation. = "The acquisition of viewpoint information, through quick reading to find the key ideas.

Process information: a specific tutorial for a certain skill. = "Follow the tutorial repeatedly to practice.

Specific information: In practice, it can be seen and tangible. = "Visualization, easy to remember.

Abstract information: Contrary to concrete information, it is invisible and intangible, mostly as concepts. = "Visualization, easy to understand.

2. Understand three methods: metaphor, internalization, and diagram method. Metaphor: compare known knowledge to unknown knowledge, which is easy to understand. = "When I was a child, when I learned the word "win", the teacher always taught it to take it apart and memorize it. Now when I write this word, I still read it silently, "Yue, Bei, Fan".

Internalization: Imagine an image in the brain of knowledge to make the image more vivid, adding sounds, smells, and feelings to form an internal picture of this knowledge, and then repeat and optimize it continuously.

Graphical method: mind map (Baidu brain map), flow chart (Giffy Diagrams), etc.

3. Expansion Use known knowledge to understand unknown knowledge, establish associations, and produce expansion.

4. Continuous testing and optimization of error correction. = "Recently, in order to exercise, I ran every day, and later found that the effect was not good, so I searched for some related running knowledge and found that my method was wrong, so I changed the previous method and it is much better now.

5. Applying the unity of knowledge and action, just looking at it doesn't make any sense, it's mainly thinking and practice.

The five steps allow you to learn the knowledge as a whole, better internalize the knowledge, and achieve the unity of knowledge and action.

### Improve efficiency
Energy management should not think that long time equals high efficiency. Use your own energy rationally. Everyone's daily energy is limited. Focus on your attention (Pomodoro Technique) so that you can be more efficient.

Don’t study. Don’t study purely for the sake of learning. You must study with a purpose in order to learn better. There are many ways to learn. Not just reading books is learning. Teaching others, watching videos, discussing, etc. is also a way of learning. .

Batch processing of the same types of things together can improve efficiency, be more focused, and reduce the cost of brain switching between different tasks.

Organized daily things organized. = "Organize your desktop, put all the items in a fixed place, establish a sense of order, will reduce the waste of time and attention scattered in the chaos. Use a notepad to record at any time, to-do items, and flash ideas. When you feel that there is no progress in your studies, you can look through the records and you will see that you have done so many things before, which can reduce your anxiety.
